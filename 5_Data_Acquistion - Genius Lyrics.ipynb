    "The Capstone scope has changed directions some, I still want to do a skip prediction model, but instead of looking at Spotify user behavior, it will be based on whether I would skip the song or not. The classification will be if the track begins with the artist announcing their name within the first verse. Using the lyrics I will do some NLP modeling. Lyrics are pulled from Genius using the Lyricsgenius library."
